Hi, 
I am Sourav Prosad. 

![myself](/assets/img/skydive.jpeg)

Born and raised in the suburban town of Hridaypur in North 24 Parganas, West Bengal, India, I have always been fascinated by the world of numbers and patterns. My passion for mathematics was evident from an early age, culminating in a significant achievement when I qualified for the Regional Mathematical Olympiad in 2010. This early success was a stepping stone that led me to delve deeper into the realm of statistics, a field that captivated me with its intricate balance of data and theory.

Driven by my interest in statistics, I pursued an academic path that further honed my skills in this area. My journey in academia seamlessly transitioned into a professional career as a Data Science expert. In the dynamic and ever-evolving field of Data Science, I specialize in classical Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP). These specialties not only allow me to work on cutting-edge technologies but also to contribute to the advancement of these fields.

Outside of my professional life, I am an avid adventurer at heart. My love for travel has taken me across the globe, exploring the cultures, cuisines, and landscapes of 8 different countries. Each journey has been a story of discovery and learning, enriching my life in countless ways. Among my most thrilling experiences is skydiving, an activity that perfectly encapsulates my love for adventure and pushing boundaries.

The majestic Himalayas hold a special place in my heart. I have embarked on 7-8 treks in this magnificent mountain range, each trek offering a unique blend of physical challenge and spiritual rejuvenation. These treks are not just physical endeavors but journeys that have shaped my perspective on life and nature.

In summary, my life is a blend of intellectual pursuit and adventurous spirit. From the quiet suburbs of Hridaypur to the soaring heights of the Himalayas and the exciting realm of Data Science, my journey is one of continuous learning and exploration.
